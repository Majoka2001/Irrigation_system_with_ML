# ML-Based Irrigation System

This project demonstrates the integration of **machine learning (ML)** into an automated irrigation system. Initially developed as a hardware-based system using Arduino, this project has been extended to include machine learning to predict irrigation needs dynamically based on environmental parameters.

## Overview
The irrigation system uses data from soil moisture, rainfall, and humidity sensors to determine whether the irrigation valve should be open or closed. By applying ML models like **Decision Trees** and **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**, this project introduces intelligent decision-making to improve the systemâ€™s efficiency and adaptability.

## Files in the Repository
1. **`Irrigation_with_ML.ipynb`**:
   - Contains the complete Python code for:
     - Generating synthetic sensor data.
     - Training ML models (Decision Tree and SVM).
     - Evaluating model performance.
   - Includes explanations and comments to make the code easy to follow.

2. **`sensor_data.xlsx`**:
   - Synthetic dataset generated to simulate sensor readings for:
     - Soil moisture levels
     - Rainfall
     - Humidity
     - Valve state (Open/Close)

3. **`model_results.csv`**:
   - Contains the evaluation metrics of the trained ML models, including accuracy and other performance details.

## Features
- **Synthetic Dataset**:
  - Generated realistic data to simulate sensor readings for prototyping.
  - Includes 10,000 rows with features: `Soil_Moisture`, `Rainfall`, and `Humidity`.
